     <p>This is a paragraph.</p>  Goodmorning my namme is Hikine palmer, I am In the 11th grade.What I plan On doing when I graduate highschool, Is go to colloge, I want to play colloge football and get a full scholarship 
to A school I like and gives out good education. I really have my eye on Penn state, and they have they eyes on me. I really like Bryant University, There head coach came to Boys latin to meet.
I read on the school and they actually have a good education purpose and good resources that could help me. I also like the community they have as a whole. I put grades first before anything.
Because without A good education or good gpa I cant play colloge football or nor get recruited cause I can't play because my gpa is low and my grades arn't accurate. 

The class Im currently taking are 
coding 1 
civics
English 11 
Philosophy
Chemistry 
Sat prep
Latin 2 
Geometry
